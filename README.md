There is my first training proj using Webpack 5. 
To start work you must have the current version npm and node (node v16.6.1 and npm 7.21.1)
To install Webpack 5 into project-folder run - $ npm i -D webpack webpack-cli

Configurations:
 $ npm start - starting dev-server
 $ npm run build - production mode
 $ npm run build-dev - development mode
